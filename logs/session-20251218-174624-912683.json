Analyze the following lecture slides to construct a comprehensive global concept map that serves as the backbone for a spaced repetition deck.\\n- Objectives: Extract explicit learning goals and implicit competency targets.\\n- Concepts: Identify the core entities, theories, and definitions. Prioritize *fundamental* concepts over trivial examples. Assign stable, short, unique IDs.\\n- Relations: Map the *semantic structure* of the domain. Use precise relation types (e.g., `is_a`, `part_of`, `causes`, `precedes`, `contrasts_with`). Note page references for traceability.\\n- Formatting: STRICTLY AVOID Markdown (e.g., **bold**). Use HTML tags for formatting (e.g., <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>) within any text fields.\\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with keys: objectives (array), concepts (array), relations (array). No prose.\\n"}, {"text": "Slide text:\nPage 1: Test\n\n\n[OCR Extracted Content]\nTest\n"}]}, "response_text": "{\n  \"objectives\": [\n    \"Establish a baseline for testing the extraction and mapping process.\"\n  ],\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"test_001\",\n      \"name\": \"Test\",\n      \"definition\": \"A procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something, especially before it is taken into widespread use.\",\n      \"category\": \"General Concept\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"relations\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"test_001\",\n      \"target\": \"test_001\",\n      \"type\": \"self_reference\",\n      \"page_reference\": \"1\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}]}
