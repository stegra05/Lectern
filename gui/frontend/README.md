# Lectern GUI

<div align="center">
  <h3>The Visual Interface for Lectern</h3>
  <p>A modern, glassmorphism-inspired React application for interacting with the Lectern engine.</p>
</div>

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The GUI is designed to be **atmospheric and focused**. It eschews standard Bootstrap/Material "flat" designs for a more tactile, frosted-glass aesthetic ("Glassmorphism").

- **Dark Mode Default:** The interface is dark-first to reduce eye strain during late-night study sessions.
- **Visual Feedback:** Every action has a transition. Progress is visualized.
- **Simplicity:** The complex configuration of the CLI is abstracted into a guided "Onboarding Flow".

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Custom CSS Variables (for the glass effects)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Animation:** Framer Motion
- **State Management:** React Hooks (Local state mostly, as the app is a simple flow)

## 🚀 Development

The frontend is served by the Python backend in production, but for development, you run it as a standalone Vite server that proxies requests to the backend.

### 1. Start the Backend
(In the root directory of the repo)
```bash
# Ensure venv is active
uvicorn gui.backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
# Backend runs on http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
(In this directory `gui/frontend`)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173
```

## 🔌 API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend via `src/api.ts`. All heavy lifting (PDF parsing, AI generation) happens on the server. The frontend listens for Server-Sent Events (SSE) or NDJSON streams to show real-time progress.

## 📦 Building for Production

The build artifact (`dist/`) is meant to be embedded into the Python application (via PyWebView or just serving static files).

```bash
npm run build
```

This populates `gui/frontend/dist`, which the Python `build_app.sh` script picks up.
